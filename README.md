# **FastAPI RAG Server**  
### As a take-home task, we propose implementing a lightweight FastAPI server for RAG. This server should utilize ChromaDB’s persistent client for ingesting and querying documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT). Leverage sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (CPU) from Hugging Face for embeddings. Ensure non-blocking API endpoints and efficient concurrency handling.
